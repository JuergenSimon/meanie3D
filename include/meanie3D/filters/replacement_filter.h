     * This filter replaces the value at each point in featurspace with a value
     * calculated from it's neighbours. It takes generally four parameters. One
     * is the mode, which can take those three values:
     * <ul>
     * <li>ReplaceWithLowest - replaces the value with the average of the x% lowest neighbours</li>
     * <li>ReplaceWithHighest - replaces the value with the average of the x% highest neighbours</li>
     * <li>ReplaceWithMedian - replaces the value with the median of all neighbours</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * Another parameter is the index of variable in the featurespace's value range that
     * is supposed to be processed.
     *
     * Next the bandwidth (the radius of the filter). The last is a percentage which is
     * used in either ReplaceWithLowest or ReplaceWithHighest (see above).
     *
     * Note that the arithmetic average can be calculated by using either lowest
     * or highest and 100%.
